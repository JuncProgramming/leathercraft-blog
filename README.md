## 🎓 What I Learned / Project Challenges

* **Server State Management**: Used **TanStack Query** to handle data fetching, caching, and loading states. This significantly reduced the amount of boilerplate code and improved the app's performance.
* **Advanced Type-Safe Routing**: Implemented **TanStack Router** to manage navigation.
* **TypeScript for Content Models**: Defined types for project and tools in a central `types.ts`, ensuring that the entire application handles data predictably from the API to the UI.
